# üöÄ Deployment Guide

## Cost Management
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Vercel deployments cost money! Only deploy when necessary.**

## Development Workflow

### 1. Local Development
```bash
# Start local development
npm run dev

# Make your changes...
# Test locally at http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Update Development (No Cost)
```bash
# Commit and push changes without deploying
./dev-update.sh "Your commit message here"

# Or with default message
./dev-update.sh
```

### 3. Deploy to Production (Costs Money!)
```bash
# Only run this when you specifically want to deploy
./deploy.sh
```
